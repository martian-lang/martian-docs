## Invoking a Pipeline

Thus far we have shown how to **define** stages and pipelines in MRO files. To **invoke** a pipeline, write an MRO file containing a pipeline `call` statement with the desired input arguments. This `call` statement is called an **invocation**. To invoke the example pipeline from above:

`invoke.mro`
```coffee
@include "pipeline.mro"

call DUPLICATE_FINDER(
    unsorted = "/home/duplicator_dave/unsorted.txt",
)
```

Typically, an invocation MRO file contains a single `@include` statement that causes the pipeline definition to be included, and a single `call` statement of that pipeline. It is generally discouraged to `call` a pipeline in the same file in which it is defined, because then the pipeline definition cannot be easily reused for other invocations with different input arguments.

## Running mrp

`mrp` is the runtime executable that runs Martian pipelines. When a pipeline is run, the instantiation of it is called a **pipestance**, which is a portmanteau of "pipeline" and "instance". The command-line interface for `mrp` is:

```sh
$ mrp <invocation_mro> <pipestance_id>
```

To start a run, provide an invocation MRO file, plus a unique
**pipestance ID**, comprising only numbers, letters, dashes, and underscores.
This ID will be the name of the directory containing the pipestance, relative
to the current working directory. When running a pipeline multiple times,
choose a different pipestance ID for each run.

`mrp` features a number of command-line options, which are documented in [Advanced Features](../advanced-features).

Once `mrp` starts, you should see the following output:

```sh
$ mrp invoke.mro piperun1
Martian Runtime - 2.2.0

2018-01-02 14:23:53 [runtime] (run:local)       ID.piperun1.DUPLICATE_FINDER.SORT_ITEMS.fork0.chnk0.main
```

At a high level, `mrp` performs the following to run a pipeline:

- Parse and validate MRO file (e.g. invoke.mro)
- Convert the MRO into a graph representation of the pipeline
- Create a directory for the pipestance named with the pipestance ID provided (e.g. piperun1)
- Begin evaluating dependencies and executing the stages of the pipeline
- Continuously monitor stages and advance through the pipeline graph when dependencies are satisfied

## Completion and Failure

If the pipestance encounters no errors while running, `mrp` exits with status 0 and writes a `_complete` file in the top level of the pipestance directory.

If the pipestance encounters does an encounter an error, `mrp` exits with status 1. The failed stage(s) will contain an `_errors` file with information about the error.

For more details about how to examine an in-progress, completed, or failed pipestance, see [Inspecting Pipelines](../inspecting-pipelines).

## Restarting

When a pipestance fails, it can be restarted by running `mrp` with the same
arguments as before. `mrp` will identify the failed stages, and reset them to
a clean state so that they can run again. Stages that have already completed
successfully will not be reset or re-run.  `mrp` attempts to verify that no
other instance of `mrp` is currently running that pipestance, and that
other settings are compatible with the previous run.  Normally retrying will
only re-run failed chunks.  If the `MRO_FULLSTAGERESET` environment variable
is non-empty, the entire failed stage will be reset.

Stages which failed with error messages that match regular expressions defined
in `martian/jobmanagers/retry.json` may be retried automatically.  `mrp` will
restart itself in such circumstances a number of times configured either from
the command line or in `retry.json` giving up.  This is useful for error
types which are expected to be transient, such as receiving a signal from the
operating system.

If `mrp` is restarted with the `--inspect` flag set, it should attempt to read
the pipestance in "read only" mode.  In combination with `--noexit` this can be
used to open up a user interface for an old pipestance.
