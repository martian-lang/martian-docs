## Stages

A **stage** is the fundamental unit of computation in Martian, and is composed
with other stages into Martian **pipelines**, which are directed, acyclic
graphs of stages.

In order to ensure pipelines can be restarted and parallelized safely, stage
inputs are intended to be considered immutable, as are the outputs once the
stage completes.

Martian stages can be [implemented in any language](../writing-stages/), and
each stage can even be implemented in a different language, if desired. Martian
manages the flow of data from the outputs of one stage to the inputs of one or
more downstream stages in the graph. Martian provides a well-structured, typed,
validated, JSON-based mechanism for exchanging data between stages in a
language-independent manner.

Here is a basic stage definition example:

~~~~
filetype txt;

stage SORT_ITEMS(
    in  txt  unsorted,
    in  bool case_sensitive,
    out txt  sorted,
    src py   "stages/sort",
)
~~~~

A stage is minimally defined by three things:

1. **Input Parameters -** A stage can declare one or more typed ```in```
parameters, to which pipeline input arguments or upstream stages' outputs
are bound. At runtime, Martian passes arguments into the stage code.
2. **Output Parameters -** Martian also provides a structured way for stage
code to return typed ```out``` values, which are passed by Martian to
downstream stages or the final pipeline outputs.
3. **Stage Code -** The ```src``` parameter specifies the executable code
that implements the logic of the stage. The type of this parameter indicates
the language of that code. For example, a stage could refer to a Python module,
or a C, C++, Go, or Rust binary, just to name a few possibilities.

Currently there are 2 values supported for the type parameter:

|`src` type|Stage type|
|---|---|
|`py`|Python stage code.  This is launched through an adapter process which provides useful utility methods for interacting with the pipeline runner.|
|`comp`|Executable code intended to run as a child process for `mrjob`.  This is the preferred way to handle compiled code.|
|`exe`|(deprecated) Executable code intended to be run directly.  Such code must manage the interface with `mrp` itself.|

Adding support for additional languages is
[fairly straightforward](https://github.com/martian-lang/martian/blob/master/adapters/README.md)
- pull requests welcome!  There is no required or preferred implementation
language in Martian. The third element of this parameter is a
language-dependent string that Martian uses to locate the code. In this
example, ```stages/sort``` is a directory that exists relative to the
```PYTHONPATH``` environment variable, and contains a valid Python module with
a ```__init__.py```.

## Pipelines

A pipeline definition comprises calls to defined stages. Each stage call must
bind its inputs to either the outputs of another upstream stage, or to the
input parameters of the pipeline itself. Here is a simple example:

~~~~
filetype txt;

stage SORT_ITEMS(
    in  txt  unsorted,
    in  bool case_sensitive,
    out txt  sorted,
    src py   "stages/sort",
)

stage FIND_DUPLICATES(
    in  txt  sorted,
    out txt  duplicates,
    src py   "stages/find_duplicates",
)

pipeline DUPLICATE_FINDER(
    in  txt  unsorted,
    out txt  duplicates,
)
{
    call SORT_ITEMS(
        unsorted = self.unsorted,
    )
    call FIND_DUPLICATES(
        sorted = SORT_ITEMS.sorted,
    )
    return (
        duplicates = FIND_DUPLICATES.duplicates,
    )
}
~~~~

The example above does the following:

- Declares a user-defined filetype `txt`
- Declares two stages `SORT_ITEMS` and `FIND_DUPLICATES`
- Declares a pipeline `DUPLICATE_FINDER` that calls both stages. It accepts one input `unsorted` which must be a filename ending in `.txt`. The `unsorted` parameter is then passed to the input of `SORT_ITEMS`, whose output is then passed to `FIND_DUPLICATES`. The output `duplicates` of `FIND_DUPLICATES` is then returned as the output of the whole pipeline.

The Martian GitHub repository includes

files for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/),
and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) text editors.  If your favorite
editor is missing from this list, pull requests are welcome.

### Composability

Pipelines specify input and output parameters the same way stages do, so they may themselves also act as stages. This allows for the composition of an arbitrary mix of individual stages and pipelines into still larger pipelines. We refer to pipelines as "subpipelines" when they are composed into other pipelines.


## Organizing Code

### MRO Files

Stage and pipeline specifications are referred to as **MRO code**, because
by convention they are written in files that have an ```.mro``` extension.

### Preprocessing with @include

Martian supports lexical preprocessing with an ```@include``` directive, which takes the path to another MRO file as an argument. This directive is evaluated by splicing the contents of the included file into the file where the directive is given, replacing the directive itself. This evaluation is recursive, and Martian keeps track of the inclusion tree in order to be able to report errors using per-source file line numbers.

`_my_stages.mro`

~~~~
filetype txt;

stage SORT_ITEMS(
    in  txt  unsorted,
    in  bool case_sensitive,
    out txt  sorted,
    src py   "stages/sort",
)
~~~~

`pipeline.mro`

~~~~
@include "_my_stages.mro"

pipeline DUPLICATE_FINDER(
    in  txt  unsorted,
    out txt  sorted,
)
{
    call SORT_ITEMS(
        unsorted = self.unsorted,
    )
    return (
        sorted = SORT_ITEMS.sorted,
    )
}
~~~~

### Stage Code vs Pipeline Code

By convention, the ```@include``` directive allows the developer to organize code into header files, although there is no formal distinction between header and non-header MRO files in Martian. Typically, stages that are logically grouped together are declared in one file, for example ```_sorting_stages.mro```, and that file would be included into another MRO file that declares a pipeline that calls these included stages. By convention, MRO files containing stage declarations should be named with the suffix ```_stages```.

### Martian Project Directory Structure

To give you an idea of how a Martian project looks in practice, here's an example:

~~~~
martian_project/
    bin/
        hello_go
        hello_rust
    lib/
        go/
            vendor/github.com/martian-lang/martian
                src/martian/adapter/adapter.go
            src/
                hello_go.go
        rust/
            Cargo.lock
            Cargo.toml
            src/
                hello_rust.rs
    mro/
        _hello_stages.mro
        hello.mro
        stages/
            hello/
                hello_py/
                    __init__.py
~~~~

## Formatting Code

Martian includes a canonical code formatting utility called `mrf`. It parses your MRO code into its abstract syntax tree and re-emits the code with canonical whitespacing. In particular, `mrf` performs intelligent column-wise alignment of parameter fields so that this:

~~~~
    stage SORT_ITEMS  (in txt unsorted,
in bool case_sensitive,
out txt sorted,
src py "stages/sort",)
~~~~

becomes this:

~~~~
stage SORT_ITEMS(
    in  txt  unsorted,
    in  bool case_sensitive,
    out txt  sorted,
    src py   "stages/sort",
)
~~~~

`mrf` is an "opinionated" formatter, inspired by tools like `gofmt`, therefore we will borrow
[their explanation](https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code) of the benefits of canonical code formatting:

- **Easier to write**: never worry about minor formatting concerns while hacking away.
- **Easier to read**: when all code looks the same you need not mentally convert others' formatting style into something you can understand.
- **Easier to maintain**: mechanical changes to the source don't cause unrelated changes to the file's formatting; diffs show only the real changes.
- **Uncontroversial**: never have a debate about spacing or brace position ever again!

`mrf` takes a list of MRO filenames as arguments. By default, it will output the formatted code back to `stdout`. If given the `--rewrite` option, it will write the formatted code back into the original files. If given the `--all` option, it will rewrite all MRO files found in your `MROPATH`. For consistency of your MRO codebase, consider configuring editor save-hooks or git commit-hooks that run `mrf --rewrite` or `mrf --all`.

`mrf` does not support any arguments that affect the formatting, otherwise it would not be canonical!

## Compiling* Code

One of the core components and principal benefits of Martian is `mrc`, a tool
which statically verifies your MRO code before you commit to a potentially
resource-intensive run of your pipeline. `mrc` identifies and helps you fix
errors that you might otherwise encounter hours, days, or even weeks into your
pipeline run.

While `mrc` does not actually compile* your code into an intermediate or
binary format, it does perform many of the same parsing and semantic checking
steps that a compiler would, helping you to write correct code, and making it
easier to perform major refactorings when necessary.

### Running `mrc`

`mrc` takes a list of MRO filenames as arguments and parses and verifies those
files, emitting line-numbered messages for any errors encountered. If given the
`--all` option, it will parse and verify all MRO files found in your `MROPATH`.
The following verification steps are performed:

- **Preprocessing**: All `@include` directives are recursively evaluated.  Any preprocessing errors, such as a file not found, will stop `mrc` and be reported.
- **Lexing and Parsing**: The MRO code produced by the preprocessor is then lexed and parsed according to the [Martian grammar](https://github.com/martian-lang/martian/blob/master/martian/syntax/grammar.y) to produce an in-memory representation of the pipeline called an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST).  Any syntax errors will stop `mrc` and be reported.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The AST produced by the parser abstract syntax tree is then analyzed according a number of semantic rules. Any semantic errors will will be reported.
  - All referenced types are built-ins or user-defined with `filetype`.
  - All called stages and pipelines are defined.
  - All parameter names are unique within each stage or pipeline interface.
  - All stage and pipeline names are unique.
  - All input parameters of stages and pipelines are bound.
  - Inputs and outputs that are bound together have matching types.
  - All pipeline output parameters are bound by a return statement.

If no errors are encountered, `mrc` returns 0, otherwise it returns a nonzero code and prints error messages to standard error.
It is recommended best practice to configure a pre-commit hook that runs `mrc --all`.

### Outputting the Abstract Syntax Tree as JSON

`mrc` also supports a `--json` option that outputs the abstract syntax tree and
associated data as a JSON object. This can be useful for further processing of
the AST in external tools.
